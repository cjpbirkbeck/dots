# NixOS Configuration
## Configuration for NixOS installations

This repository holds my configurations for using and installing [NixOS](http://www.nixos.org/), a Linux distribution build to Nix package manager, which tries to bring the function programming paradigm to package building and distribution, with the operating system bring that paradigm to system configuration. Currently, this only works with my laptop, but I am going bring to my desktop, various virtual machines that I would use for, and any servers where I can install it.

I put these out for most didactic and education proposes. It's not complete with many things to be completed, but I do hope it could be of use to others.

TODO:
* Write the updating and backup files.
* Bring the nix files for my desktop into this repository, where I could use for that machine as well.
* Add configuration files for software I do not use any more into branches.
* Make the cofiguration usable for any virtual machine images.
* Make the cofiguration usable on an server system.
